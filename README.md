THE PICKLE APP

i will be making an app for pickles

the home page (a component) -
    there will be a nav bar (a component) -
        the nave bar will hold the title of the app and well as nav buttons to types of pickles
        if there is time this will also hold a button to a page to shop ohio pickles, just links to sites to shop 
    the body of the home page will have a picture as well as a welcome to this site (a component) with a little bit of an about what youll find from this page 
    * if there is time there will be another section of the on the home page for if youre intrested in pickleing other things besides cucumbers (if this is made this will be another comonent) and will have a button to take you to a page of other recipies for pickeling 

when going to the types page (a component) there will be the list of types of pickels, when clicking on the tpye it will the show you some info of this pickle and well as a link to a recipie

i will be making a the array of types of pickles with the info and link for the type in the typescript file in the component that will be holding the type part of the app. i was firsk going to make a seprate file with this array to use through out the app, but i realized that as this is my first app i will want to keep it a bit more simple and focuse on making it work.

with this ap i will be routing the types component of the app to the main page 

i am looking to have these components-
    the navigation bar (sub compontent of the main)
    the welcome section (sub compontent of the main)
    a header with the name of the app (sub compontent of the nav bar)
    the intrested in more in (sub compontent of the main)
    the type that will be on the page that the type button takes you to 
the app will be devided this way  because i think this is good orginazation. having the sub component in the nav componet will allow me to style them differently if i choose and to keep the buttons the app needs to work and the header seprate with out confusing any of the information. the welcome section is seprate because this will also mostly be for looks of the page, and keeping that and the intrested in more seprate (that will have buttons to another page) will help not have one componenet hold too much and keep the code clean with out confusion



mission as a part of the welcome component -    
    Our mission at pickle heaven is teaching everyone how easy it is to pickle with originality, innovation and creativity
